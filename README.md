# Loan-eligibility
Bank Loan Eligibility Classifier  

this project was made to test 6 classification algorithms (DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, Naive Bayes and KNN).

Data preprocessing was made greatly and that resulted in an accuracy between 84% and 86% which is good in regards to the data set which is only 614 rows.
